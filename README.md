I have created an API-based app which queries live hourly data and provides visual analysis for weather conditions

The link to the app is :

Weather App : INFO

This app is an Api-based app which queries the live hourly data from weatherapi.com for seven days for the selected city
and provides visual analysis for the weather conditions.
I have joined the api to gather the live weather data for different cities according to the user's selection.

Item 1:
Multiple Plots explain the collected data visually. The slider can be used to change the binning size for the plots.
I have also included drop-down lists for group of variables for a more interactive experience.

Item 2:
For Item 2, I have analyzed different variables in the dataset and fitted them to the correct probability distribution models for prediction.
Also plotted the PDF and CDF of the generated points using the plots.

Item 3:
Using Statistical Tests, we can check the independence of the variables in the dataset.
I also analyzed the goodness of fit of a feature with a given class probability.
